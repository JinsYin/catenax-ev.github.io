The life cycle management of the Catena-X ecosystem is coordinated by the Catena-X Association and includes the releases in the Catena-X Association and in the Eclipse Tractus-X Project (see Figure Overview Life Cycle Management). It is planned to provide quarterly releases including one major and three minor releases per year. Both releases follow calendar versioning (see CalVer), whereas their artifacts such as standards, normative documents, products, and KITs follow semantic versioning (see SemVer). To ensure backward compatibility in the future (see Chapter Backward Compatibility), versioning and passing of predefined test cases of each individual artifact is mandatory.","sidebar":"sidebar_op_model"},"operating-model/operating-model/operating-model":{"id":"operating-model/operating-model/operating-model","title":"Catena-X Operating Model","description":"This page is currently an MVP and is under construction.
