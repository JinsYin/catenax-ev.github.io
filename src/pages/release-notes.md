### Further Scope Clarification

To maintain the integrity and reliability of the onboarding process, the signing of self-descriptions by the Gaia-X Digital Clearing House (GXDCH) will be temporarily suspended:

- This suspension only affects the [CSP-B](/docs/operating-model/who-roles-in-the-catena-x-ecosystem/who-roles-in-the-catena-x-ecosystem.md#core-service-provider-b) role within the following CACs:
  - [CX-0001](/docs/standards/CX-0001-EDCDiscoveryAPI/CX-0001-EDCDiscoveryAPI.md)
    - The provided SD documents MUST be GAIA-X compliant, i.e. MUST provide a compliance credential issued from GAIA-X AISBL. â€“ to be temporarily deactivated
  - [CX-0006](/docs/standards/CX-0006-RegistrationAndInitialOnboarding/CX-0006-RegistrationAndInitialOnboarding.md).
    - Onboarding service providers / core service providers MUST ensure the creation of a Self-Description (SD) of the Legal Person as part of the application verification process. The SD MUST be stored in a central location and MUST be in line with the GAIA-X standards/guidelines

The functionality of Catena-X and the security framework will remain unaffected furthermore the validation of company data and identifiers will continue as usual.
