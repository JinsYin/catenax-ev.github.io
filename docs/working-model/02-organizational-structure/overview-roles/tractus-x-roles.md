It's important to recognize that the role of a contributor is not confined to this description alone. Open source is a realm of limitless possibilities, and contributors are encouraged to find unique ways to enhance the project based on their individual skills and creativity. The official description for a contributor within Tractus-X can be found [here](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/contributor-committer#contributor).

While there is no formal commitment required, consistent and quality contributions can lead to recognition within the community and may open the door to additional roles, such as becoming a committer or joining an Expert Group.

## Committer

Committer in an Eclipse project holds the authority to directly contribute changes to the project's source code repository. They are responsible for reviewing and integrating contributions from other community members, ensuring adherence to project standards and guidelines (in our case TRGs). Additionally, committers play a key role in decision-making processes within the project, actively participating in discussions and providing leadership to drive the project forward.

Committers hold a position of trust and responsibility in an open source project. As seasoned contributors who have demonstrated commitment and expertise, they are granted write access to the project's code repository. This role description outlines the core responsibilities and expectations of a committer, but it is important to note that the scope of this role can extend beyond these parameters as the project evolves.

While the role is defined by certain responsibilities, committers are also ambassadors of the project's values and culture, and they play a significant part in shaping the project's future.
