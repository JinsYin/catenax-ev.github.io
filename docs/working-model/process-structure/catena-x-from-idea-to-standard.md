![Catena-X process overview](assets/release-planing-next-steps-horizontal-catena-x.drawio.svg)

## Phase 1: Planning

During the planning phase demands for new Standards or for the change of an existing one must be identified. Both might cause of adaptations in Semantic Models, Logic/Schema, API Specification, Protocols. All intended work on standards should be announced in the Association.

### Planning milestones

- **Release Roadmap Review**: The first official announcement of roadmap items by Committees is intended to identify stakeholders as soon as possible. This will facilitate the initiation of alignment efforts and the kickoff of the refinement of the roadmap items.

## Phase 2: Refinement

A detailed description of the change request or new standard request is needed and should be refined during the refinement phase. The detailed description needs to be discussed during the planning days with the audience (Committees and Expert Groups) and especially with the TC4S (Technical Committee 4 Standardization). All dependencies must be identified/discussed/aligned.

All requests must be submitted to TC4S for approval within CX Houston at latest x days after the standard planning event. If the request is approved, the applicant will receive their branch in the standardization repository (within Catena-X e.V. GitHub Organization) to work on the standard.

### Refinement milestones

- **Standards Planning** (same dates as Release Planning): In this event, dependencies of the requests to other standards MUST be identified the latest. All committee and expert members will be invited to this meeting.
- **Deadline for standard requests**: On this day, all standard requests in CX Houston MUST be submitted. A later submission of a standard request will be rejected by default!

## Phase 3: Implementation

New standards and changes of existing standards must be implemented in the standardization repository. Each standard request is implemented in an own branch.

If multiple individuals seek to implement a standard request and need alignment, they must organize this collaboration themselves. The private workspace of the respective Expert Group should be utilized for this purpose.

### Implementation milestones

- **Start Opt-Out for standard candidates**: Each development cycle for standards ends with a 45 days opt out phase. Until this day all work on the standard must be finished.
