![Overview Tractus-X Release phases](assets/release-planing-next-steps-horizontal-tractus-x.drawio.svg)

## Phase 1: Preparation

The Preparation Phase is the foundational phase that sets the direction and scope for the entire release. It ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the release's content.

All planned work on Kits, Reference Implementation, API Specification, Protocols, Sample Data, Architecture, Documentation, Deployment Scripts or Tutorials should be announced during this phase.

### Preparation ToDo's

- [Create roadmap item](../release-management/planning/roadmap-item-creation.md)

### Preparation milestones

- [Release Roadmap Review](../release-management/planning/cx-release-roadmap-review.md)

## Phase 2: Planning

The Planning Phase is a critical stage in the project or release lifecycle where initial plans and requirements are detailed, validated, and prepared for implementation. The goal of this phase is to ensure that all aspects of the project are clearly understood, accurately defined, and ready to be built, reducing the risk of issues during the implementation phase.

A detailed description of detailed steps can be found here.
