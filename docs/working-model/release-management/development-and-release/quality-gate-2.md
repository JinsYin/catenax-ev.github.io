# Quality Gate 2 (QG2)

## Task

Considering that Catena-X standards are the basis for its operations as well as conformity assessment for all corresponding actors and applications on the data ecosystem, it is of paramount importance that quality standards are met. A second quality gate (“quality gate II”) thus ensures that only standard candidates that correspond to the quality expectations of Catena-X are being released. During quality gate II, the maturity of the standard is being verified and, provided a green light is given, a technical recommendation for its release is made to the [Management Board](../../organizational-structure/catena-x/management-board.md).
