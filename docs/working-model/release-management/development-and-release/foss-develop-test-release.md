# FOSS: Develop, Test & Release

## Description

The development and release phase comprises the development of the software and standards. The individual units are developed and tested in up to six increments. This is followed by the final integration and end-to-end test for the software and an opt-out phase for the developed standards. If successful, the individual units are then released, published, and will be deployed.
