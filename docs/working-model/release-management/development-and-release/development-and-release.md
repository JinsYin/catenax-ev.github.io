# Development & Release (week 15 â€“ 30)

The development and release phase includes the development of the software and standards. The individual units are developed and tested in up to six increments. This is followed by final integration and end-to-end test for the software. In addition there is an opt-out phase for commenting on the developed standards (45 days). If successful the individual units will be released and published.
The description on the right and the following slides describe the target image with which process steps the development and release of both the FOSS and the standards takes place.

The current working model can be found on the Github page of the association
Process Organization - From Idea to Release
There is already a separate description of the standardization process. It will therefore not be described in detail in this manual. However, the explanations at the end of the chapter are intended to provide a brief insight into the standardization procedure and how the opt-out phase works.
