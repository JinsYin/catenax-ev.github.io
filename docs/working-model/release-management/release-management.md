# Release Management - Phases

## Preparation Phase (4 weeks)

In line with the organisation's vision and strategy the purpose of the preparation phase is to have an initial rough plan for each single release in terms of content and deadlines. This involves identifying technical topics (architecture, software development, (new) features and updates) as well as associated standards that are to be implemented.

## Planning (10 weeks)

The planning phase is becoming more concrete. Expert groups & development teams are now going into more detailed planning for the individual releases. The focus is now on using the roadmap and the backlog to specify and prioritize the content of the subsequent development activities. At the end of the phase there is agreement among the parties involved on the planned features, updates and standards.

## Development & Release (15 weeks)

The Development & Release phase deals with the development, release and deployment of new features and standards. Increments are organized in six sprints of two weeks each. This also includes the individual integration tests, the E2E tests and the opt-out phase for the current release of the developed standards. Finally, work is carried out on the final release package.
