# Catena-X Organizational Structure

Each group or role is vital to the project's ecosystem and contributes uniquely to its growth and direction. **As we delve into the specifics of each role, we invite you to consider where your skills and interests may best align with the needs of the project.** Whether you are just starting out or looking to increase your involvement, there is a place for everyone to contribute and make an impact in our open source community.

![Overview](assets/groups-roles.drawio.svg)

## Catena-X Automotive Network e.V

- Catena-X is structured along Committees and Expert Groups
- Committees and Expert Groups are mapped to products or use cases
  - Role of Catena-X Association
  - Rolle der Mitarbeiter innerhalb im Verein (z.B. Expert Groups, Committees)
  - The Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. promotes, sponsors, and coordinates the overlying requirements of the Eclipse Tractus-X Project.

Committees and Expert Groups are advertised, selected, and established on the basis of a “requirement”. The application phases are similar and the distributors are always the Catena-X members. More information can be found [here](catena-x/catena-x.md).

To get a better overview of the given Committees and Expert Groups, there will be a SharePoint page within the member area. Information about:

- The groups
- Purpose
- Member
- Important meetings
- Milestones

The **Catena-X Automotive Network e.V.** is often referred to as 'the association'. It is important to understand that the association consists of four bodies with different tasks and responsibilities. The association bodies are:

- The Management board
- Committees
- Expert Groups
- Catena-X office

Please note that while this page captures the essence of the Committee and the Expert Group roles, it is not exhaustive. The dynamic nature of the association means that roles can evolve, and members of the Committee and Expert Groups may engage in additional activities beyond what is described here. The descriptions below are intended to serve as a guide, providing a clear indication of the expected contributions of the Committee and the Expert Groups, yet it allows for flexibility and adaptation as the project and its needs grow and change.

Can be found there.

The sharepoint pages can only be accessed by association members.
