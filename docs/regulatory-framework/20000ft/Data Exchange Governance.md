# Data Exchange Governance

An important document at this level is the Data Exchange Governance. This Data Exchange Governance sets out the key principles for data exchange that apply to each Participant when exchanging data in the Catena-X Data Space for one or more purposes as predefined by the Association ("Predefined Purpose(s)"). Each Participant must agree to this Data Exchange Governance in order to effect data exchanges through a registered connector. The process of agreeing to this Data Exchange Governance, as well as for concluding legally binding data exchange contracts is not part of this Data Exchange Governance. It does not determine or restrict how Participants need to make their contractual declarations legally binding. Rather, the Data Exchange Governance contains standardised technical parameters for data exchange and other mandatory requirements that correspond to the predefined purposes described in more detail under the following link [repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).
